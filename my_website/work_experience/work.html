<h1>Work Experience</h1>

<h2>
    Summer Placement with University of Liverpool Physics Department
</h2>
<p>
    Project was to build a compact particle accelerator which could be used to image rock art. My placement involved running simulations of an RFQ particle accelerator in Octave. I also created three dimensional plots of electric and magnetic fields within the accelerator in Python and Matlab.
