<h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>I read most days, usually fantasy or science fictions, such as Joe Abercrombies First Law Trilogy, or George R R Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire</p>
<h2>Running</h2>
I began running around 10 years ago in an attempt to increase my fitness. I have since come to enjoy it and consider it more of a hobby than a chore
<h2>Guitar</h2>
<p>I started playing guitar at 16, and played consistently for about 6 years. Although I still enjoy playing guitar I find I have less time now, and so do not practice as much as I would like to.</p>
