<h1>Education</h1>
<h2>University of Liverpool - Theoretical Physics MPhys</h2>
<p>I studied an integrated masters in theoretical physics at the university of liverpool. My masters thesis was on the behaviour of geodesic curves near the event horizons of black holes</p>
<h2>Carmel College - Foundation Year</h2>
<p>Due to the long break between me leaving school and deciding to go to university, it was neccesary for me to first complete a foundation year. This was run by the University of Liverpool through Carmel College in St Helens. I studied physics and maths here</p>
